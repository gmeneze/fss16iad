## Use whatever ide you like (Ian uses Pycharm, VS Code, and Anaconda2 for IDEs + Platform) but we need to make sure it works in Cloud9 after we finish each coding assignment as that is what the TA uses to check code.
### [Coding assignment for hw1] (https://github.com/txt/ase16/blob/master/doc/hw1.md)
1. Watch the great [Kent Beck video on how to write a test engine in just a few lines of code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIonZ6-4nuU). Note
that that example is in CoffeeScript. For the equivalent Python code, see
[utest.py](../src/utest.py).
2. Get the Python equivalent of the watch command used by Beck. Specifically, run the command
   `sudo pip install rerun`
3. Download the `utest.py`
4. Write a python file `main.py` that imports `utest.py` and code from `who1.py who2.py who3.py`;
   i.e. one file per member of your team.
4. Get two windows open:
	 + One editing main.py
	 + One in a shell
5. In the shell, type `rerun "python -B main.py"`
6. Add one more unittest to `main.py`.
     + Important... leave behind at least one failing test.
     + Save the file. Watch the code run.
